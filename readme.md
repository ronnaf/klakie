# background

it's annoying to copy time entries from clockify because the timer starts when you hit `ctrl+c`
so i decided to just make a webapp that pulls my data from clockify and just display the time entries in decimal format that i can easily copy.

# weird expo web issues

you can't go to a specific url like `https://klakie.vercel.app/landing`. it would return a 404 not_found error. didn't get the chance to look for a workaround yet.
